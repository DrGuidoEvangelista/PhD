str(bio1)  #function to view the structure of the file

summary(bio1) #function to view the statistical summary of the file (average values, maximum vale etc.)

s <- summary(bio1)    #to assign a simplier character to the summary function and make it shorter

bio1[,2]
bio1$MU         #ways to display the second column: 2 is the second column of the datased while MU is the name of the column

#to select and view column 2 and row 3 of bio1:
bio1[3,2]
bio1$MU[3]  #this will display a single value in the cell 


#to display the length of column Concentration of the file bio1:
length(bio1$Concentration)


#creating a new column in which we convert the values in factors 
bio1$Treatment2 <- as.factor(bio1$Treatment)
#so if we write this line
summary(bio1)
#we can see that in the Treatment2 column there are x Algae and y NoAlgae (basically it counted the data)

#create a new column with the division between the Concentration column and Mesocosm
bio1$Concentration4 <- bio1$Concentration/bio1$Mesocosm


bio1[(bio1$ID < 10),]  #the dataset will only take the data from the row ID which are <10


bio5 <- bio1[,-8]  #in this way I removed the 8th column from the database displayed

bio3[bio3$Abundance==0,]
bio3$abundance_cat  <- -1   in this way I created a new column and assigned a rule

bio3$abundance_cat[bio3$Abundance==0] <- 0  #when in the Abundance column the values are 0, also in the new column abundance_cat the values will be 0



#c function to combine objects
bio1.small<-bio1[,c(1,6)] 
bio1.small<-bio1[,c("ID","Concentration")]  #this is the way to select these 2 columns in the same way

bio1.small<-bio1[,1:6]   #in order to select all the columns from 1 to 6


rep(1:6, 5)
rep(1:6, each=5)  #tools to create sequences


##Combining data frames

#adding rows - the two datased need to have the same number of columns 
bio12 <- rbind(bio1,bio2)

#avoid merging cells in excel
